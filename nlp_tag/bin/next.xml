		<CSubject>hey Ice Maiden,
don't know</CSubject>
		<CBody>hey Ice Maiden,
don't know how to explain this .. but will try my best

1-  Fechlewe asked about some Qatari words that starts with Sub .. and  king_qatar  explained to him what Su exactly means .. i guess u get this part :P

2- nasserqtr gave another example that i found funny to an extent .. which was     which literally means "pour some water on the wide beans ... but in arabic .. sub el may ala el bajila .. and i found a bit funny

3- king_qatar posted a poem and said the last letter of that poem .. which is some how a known challenge to the next poster to post a poem that starts with letter that his poem ended with and thats what i did

hope u get me</CBody>

		<CBody>Rightly pointed out, that is an underutilized and overlooked source that can easily be converted to usable energy in Qatar. Perhaps the reason behind this is an abundance of other natural resources available for use, leaving an alternative source not much important in present scenario. Nevertheless, I think if such source could be 'sold' to the authorities, there are all the chances for the decision makers to sit up and take notice.</CBody>

	<QSubject>Where can I buy proper alcohol free wine???</QSubject>
	<QBody>Hi I would like to find somewhere that sells alcohol free wine - I don't mean sweet grape juice in a wine bottle, but proper dry (ie not sweet)fermented wine that has been de-alcoholized). Dry non alcoholic beer is available here, but I can't find non alcoholic wine - I would be really pleased if someone could help me out with some suggestions. 

many thanks!</QBody>

		<CBody>Yes such a thing exists, just like for beer - they make it as usual then use one of several processes to remove the alcohol without removing the distinctive taste. 

LOL I would liken it to a car with no emissions rather than no wheels!!! 

Some people, for medical, religious, driving or other reasons  (my mum for example gets drunk after a thimble-full of wine) like to enjoy the taste of wine without the alcoholic effects. 

Here is a website selling it, but I want it here in Qatar!!! I would have thought that with all the rich arabs around, there would be a demand for it......

		<CBody>LOL most of the non alcoholic beers do indeed taste appalling, more like horlicks, however as a previously committed beer drinker and member of the Campaign for Real Ale, I can say that some alcohol free beers are acceptable. The key to it is de-alcoholising a fully fermented malt, rather than halting the fermentation early, which leaves it sweet-tasting. In doha the only one that is ok is holsten, but others exist outside doha. 

still waiting for someone to point me in the right direction!</CBody>

		<CSubject>RE: How is Ford Explorer?</CSubject>
		<CBody>Hi, I have an older 2003 model. It drives very well. No problems. I bought it because it's more compact than the large Toyotas. Drives more like a car. Steering &amp; handling good. Power is good. 4.0ltr V6 is well tried &amp; tested.
This is the biggest selling SUV in America for many years.
No problems at all with service &amp; none for spare parts if you visit the Ford Service centre. I was just out there on Saturday to get a new cap for the brake master cylinder reservoir which some-how went missing. They looked it up on the computer - cost was QR10. Plus a new rubber bumper for the rear door latch was also missing - again no problem at all. Cost QR5.

that was related to my LAN settings. (in my Office). My network admin was blocked the gtalk service from the gateway. (Gtalk will be connected and type chat is possible..but the mic will not work.)

		<CBody>Hey mate, the Fingerprints dept. is currently located in Lusail. 

the location is as follows:

if the new exhibition centre is on your right hand side and ahead of you is the pearl island then keep straight ahead of the zig zag tower (leaving in on your right hand side) after the zig zag tower you'll find a round about, make a right from there and you'll find Golf Club on your right side. keep straight until u find the last roundabout on that road. make a right from the last r/a (theres only way to right &amp; left from there)and keep straight until you find a petrol station on your right (Wasil Petrol Station) then make a left from that pertrol station R/A. keep straight then make left again from the next r/a and there you'll find this finger print dept on your right hand side.

		<CBody>because:

1. They became busy in their REAL LIVES that they had no time to log on to QL (work and/or personal)

2. They have no internet connection at home or QL got blocked in their office.

3. They lost interest because of too much bickering about religious and political topics and no other interesting topics to talk about.

4. They because addicted to FACEBOOK farmville and all those other games...lmao

		<CSubject>Yeah</CSubject>
		<CBody>Yeah Last wednesday morning , i got the shock , when is aw hoards of people working in Doha walking to Oryx Rotana and in notime Rotana was looking like a railway station in India . Then realised that they all had come for interviews for NDIA jobs where recruitment was going on , on the 1st floor of Oryx Rotana . Later they ended up collecting all candidates CV,s and told them -they will call them later , which provided some space in the hotel for the people staying there . 

I guess this Question is related to the above .

But wonder how people working here can switch jobs locally without NOC or all these people on visit visa hunting for jobs ? </CBody>

		<CBody>There are several things you can do.
1. sprinkel your bed with pif paf powder and after it having been on your matress, hovver it up.
2. do the above, then let it sit out in the sun for several hours.
3. buy a new matress.
I also recommend you treat your house and get the pest control in.
You can google to find more info on this suject matter!

		<CBody>hope this helps :)

You will be given a form to complete with a list of the relevant documents: approval letter from work, bank statement of salary for the last six months (for non-government employees), marriage certificates, children's birth certificates and education certificates (although you don't always need these in practice). The last three should be certified, but in practice you probably don't need to. Photocopies are acceptable. You also need passport photos of yourself, your spouse and your children.

	<QSubject>Help!! How to stop severe hair fall</QSubject>
	<QBody>I know this topic has been beaten to a pulp, so to speak. But my problem is not Male Pattern Baldness (Alopecia) which is genetic and can't be stopped, for now. I'm starting to lose much more than the normal amount of hair that falls every day. Does anyone out there know or is using some home remedy to stop hair fall? Please share. I'm worried that if it continues, it will result to something like this:

		<CBody>I think (when I took a loan from HSBC) you will have to pay a high interest during the first year if you want to clear your loan.  After the first year you pay only 1% on the balance amount and get a clearance letter.

But it is always better to check with the customer service at the bank as sometimes rules change and each bank may have their own policy.  However, Qatar Central bank Set the rules, so be sure the bank is not ripping you off.</CBody>

		<CBody>yes they do apply a penalty. and i think it's 1 or 2% of the remaining amount without interest.
So basically if you had to pay 100 QR (no interest included) you will end up paying 101 QR. 

They apply this penalty because they are not entitled to charge you the interest anymore.

		<CBody>The procedure is simple but it takes some time. You will go to Ahli and tell them that you want to Repay your loan in full. They will make the paperwork and contact you.

Normally there are no taxes besides the leftover amount you have to pay back.
But this is Qatar... nothing is normal when it comes to banking. So they might charge you... why don't you just give them a call and ask.</CBody>

		<CBody>1.toshibas have this bad rep of overheating. check if your fan is working. your laptop's cooling system might've accumulated lots of dust. Jarir's toshiba service centre will charge you 200 bucks to run so called "diagnostics". All your laptop needs is a bit of spring cleaning! :D

2. Also check your RAM modules. If you have multiple modules (like two 1GB chips), one may have gone busted! Try alternating your modules and running your laptop!

		<CBody>I am not sure if you will find Proactive in Qatar. Skincare is something which the consumers have a sort of loyalty. A consumer who is using Clinque, Clarins or Lancome products are not going to change to a new brand even if it is having very good products or marketing strategy. It will be difficult for a Brand like Proactive to survive in a niche skincare market like Qatar. It will be better if you can buy it on line or arrange with someone to buy it from US.</CBody>

If thats the best thats on offer, better neither of them turn up at Wembley for the final and United just take the trophy by default.

		<CBody>Renting law in Qatar states that if your RP is cancelled the landlord must refund all paid rents and return the cheques. The normal notice period is 1 month but you are not responsible if you are fired without notice and your RP cancelled.

		<CBody>Deposit amount...Yes but, about the taken back the checkes b4 the end of the leasing contract...depends on the contract between the two parties..but usually this issue can be solved by posting an early termination letter to the lanlord befor 2-3 month from the date of leaving.

		<CBody>As I know legally you shall pay for entire contract period and the land lord will not be in need to return your cheque. But here the land lords will be very happy when they understand you are leaving since they can give to some one for higher rent. In addition they will get rent amount for one or two months from the date of vacating.(Free rent).

If you are lucky u will get back your cheques without any deduction. But remember u r in qatar.</CBody>

		<CBody>Because some nationalities are more likely to bring over elderly relatives to take advantage of the healthcare that is provided here.

And those same nationalities are less likely to come and visit here and spend lots of money on accomodation, shopping etc.  Unless you are contributing to the economy, either as a wage earner or a high spending tourist, you aren't really welcome here. 

And if your parents are that age, you should be visiting them, not vice versa.</CBody>

		<CSubject>RE: Cruel conditions for visa ??</CSubject>
		<CBody>Well I don't believe it has anything to do with the health care issue. First of all HMC only treats for free those who have a health card and therefore they must be residents not visitors, if you don't have a health card you'll pay for whatever treatment you get except for emergencies. Second thought let us say it was really all about health care issues and not providing the emergency cases for free to sick elders who are none residents then simply the sponsor could be asked to sign a form where he will be responsible for any unsettled treatment payments for a visiting relative, or perhaps those over a certain age could pay in the airport a health insurance fee, instead of simply not allowing the elderly -who should be treated with more respect honestly- to enter. After all what's the median age of the parents of working residents here? 40? I don't think so. But as some people say it's their roof, their country, let them do with it what ever they want.</CBody>

		<CBody>TRAVELLING BY CAR IS QUITE EASY, AFFORDABLE AND ENJOYABLE. BUT A BIT EXPENSIVE COMPARING TO BUS TRAVEL. BUT THIS IS QUITE EASY AND FOR THE ROADS THESE ARE EXCELLENT. YOU WILL HAVE TO RECHECK YOUR VEHICLE BEFORE TRAVELLING. ESPECIALLY THE TYRES. AND EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE ROUTES, JUST NO PROBLEM (EITHER TAKE  GPS OR YOU WILL HAVE TO TRAVEL ON THE HIGHWAY STRAIGHT. AND YOU CAN ASK ANYONE ON THE GAS STATION IN THE WAY, THEY WILL GUIDE YOU.

TRAVELLING ON YOUR OWN CAR WILL BE A GREAT EXPERIENCE. 

HAVE A NICE TRIP

		<CBody>PAY QRS 250 AT THE COUNTER
THAT'S IT.

No more test...
No more driving school.........
No more Tension....

Know what tension is ?
&lt;STRONG&gt;
TENSION = FORCE / LENGTH
FORCE = MASS X ACCELERATION
ACCELERATION = VELOCITY/TIME
VELOCITY = DISPLACEMENT/TIME
TIME = VERY PRECIOUS DONT WASTE IT&lt;/STRONG&gt;

	<QSubject>Cost for Church Wedding (How Much?)</QSubject>
	<QBody>Good day to all.

I would like to ask how much it would cost for a SMALL/SIMPLE Church Wedding (Roman Catholic)?  I think its a better option than just a civil wedding.

Please EXCLUDE the wedding reception as it will be already sponsored for.

Thank you so much.</QBody>

In our custom if any one want to marry in church they have to fulfill the following requirements:

1 - Pre-marriage course certificate 
2 - Letter from the parish priest (current, if working), stating that, you are registered with that parish and have no wife and kids for the best of (priest's)knowledge.
3 - Letter from the bride's parish priest stating the  above. 
4 - 2 witness 

If you wanna marry in Qatar, u and ur would-be will have to give your native parish priest's letter (NOC)to the priest in Doha. </CBody>

		<CBody>Um, if its Roman Catholic it should be free! You can just speak with the priest and make a subtle offering to them which is up to you. They may ask you not to bring in flowers etc and it is really just up to you. If you have it outside of Italy then you will have to have all your documents etc sent off to the Vatican for registration and they will want to know details about your local diocese. 

Congratulations and best of luck. If I can offer any advice to folks getting married is don't spend large on flowers and decorations (apart from for the brides bouquet, it will be in lots of photos) and do spend up large on the photographer as you will want quality. </CBody>

	<QBody>Hi

Is is true that now people employed in various companies in Qatar are free to change jobs.
Comapnies surely must give NOC without any fuss - is it the new rule!!
It will be great if this comes true - there's a rumor that after 18th Dec 2010 this new rule will be applied to the relief of all employees here in Qatar
Pl let us know

		<CBody>Well, I follow Paleo diet; therefore, I am after grass fed meat which is likely impossible in Qatar. I used to in Australia where mostly cattle are grass fed. I know, they can't export their grass fed animals because they don't look healthy physically but still Aussie meat will be somewhat grass-fed.

		<CBody>VANMOST, 
 I found Australian Lamb at Mira that is very fatty but so nice in taste.  It is about 15 QR per Kilo.  When I read what you said about grass fed animals and how importers do not prefer it, I thought maybe that lamb is grass fed, that's why it's less in price and has more fat.  Please reply because I was looking for grass fed meat since I arrived in Qatar last year but no way the stores will tell you what kind of food animals have.  If that Mira lamb is grass fed it will be the greatest news for me, since it tastes nice and much less in price than other meats.

		<CBody>@Nomerci...

As I told earlier, grass fed animals don't look healthy and they got yellow fat as well. Therefore, mostly importers don't want that meat because consumers are not aware of facts.

So, every exporter has to give some grains and corn to animals even Aussie and New Zealanders also do.

But still their meat is rich in Omega 3...

I know, it will be hard to follow Paleo or maybe I have to converted it into low carb... But I will try my best :)</CBody>

		<CBody>If you are looking a well experienced OBGYN, then the answer is Dr. Khudisia and the clinic is located on Al Saad - Villagio road.

If you drive from Alsaad - Villagio, Alsaad main signal, drive, after reaching the third signal, turn a U-TURN and u can find the clinic on the right hand side at the end of the road nearby the second signal, which you passed.

QAR 100 is the charge and there is scanning facilities also.

		<CBody>Dr Khudsia Begum is a very nice doctor. Patient as well as understanding. the only problem in her clinic is the amount of people, hence you need to be prepared to wait for ur turn (and the wait can be anywhere between 15 minutes to 4 hours).</CBody>

		<CBody>&lt;i&gt; First of all: what kind of taxes do I have to pay for insurance (especially health insurance) &lt;/i&gt;

Make sure the company give you health insurance in your package.

&lt;i&gt; and is there some kind of tax for the salary (income tax) as in Germany? &lt;/i&gt;

Qatar is Tax Free, but check in Germany as to their rules for how long you need to be away to be exempt back home

&lt;i&gt; What do you personally think about the income, especially if you like spending money =) &lt;/i&gt;

For someone your age that's not bad. After food you will be saving most of that.

		<CBody>If you have just moved to Qatar you will not be able to get a car unless you have your RP stamped, Qatar ID in hand, and a bank account that has at least your first month's salary transferred into it (some banks require more than that)

After you are done, the fun of buying a car starts...get out there yourself and visit the showrooms, sit in the cars and see which one your arse likes better. 

Once you've picked your car to your satisfaction...then come on QL and post a topic asking everyone's review about the car. :P</CBody>

		<CSubject>You will be banned for 2yrs</CSubject>
		<CBody>You will be banned for 2yrs once your RP is cancelled, which is why you need to reassure that your current employer will grant you an NOC to return. Please note that your RP must be cancelled prior to exit, otherwise your new employer wont be able to apply a new visa for you.  Once you exit the State, and with an NOC on hands, things will be fine with you, in God's will!

But changing sponsor within a year working of the same sponsor with a work visa/permanent visa stamped on your passport and without EXIT will not be possible for you as per Immigration Rules. You can double check with your company's PRO, though.</CBody>

I have seen a guy, who changed after 8 months of his joining.

		<CBody>guys, no need to doubt it! I HAVE CHANGED the sponsorship within 1 year. I PERSONALLY. As the matter of fact, my RP was just "5 month old" at that time...
 Apple, NOC is NOC. It means the previous sponsor does not mind you to work for another company. You can either transfer your sponsorship right away, even within 1 year, sometimes even without leaving qatar, or you can leave Qatar, to find another job and come back any time without waiting till 2 year ban is over.
All the guy needs is NOC letter. And hey, it's better not to belong to very few nationalities when as someone said, he might be asked to leave qatar within 48 hours. But this is a different story and has nothing to do with NOC, or duration of work with the previous sponsor. Some people try to just renew  their RPs and asked to leave country.
So get a NOC and good luck with your new job!

		<CSubject>Apple, someone asked me</CSubject>
		<CBody>Apple, someone asked me once: what are the immigration/labour rules in Qatar? My answer was simple: Rule #1 (and often the only 1): "There are NO rules".
What is perfectly working for one, irrespective of  ones nationality, gender, age, religion, political preferences, etc., might not working for another, irrespective of anothers nationality, gender...see above :)...
Moreover, whatever worked for one person once, might not work for the same person next time (with the same name, same passport number, same nationality, same gender.. see above.. )
So, when the questing starts from "IS IT POSSIBLE...?", the answer is "EVERYTHING is possible".
And that was my point, dear :) how are you anyway? Long time

		<CBody>No one is argueing with with the Saddam issue we all know how bad he was, but you have to remind yourself what was the reason for the Iraq War, George W. Bush stated "Weapons of Mass Destruction", but back then most Iraqis (again the people who lived in Iraq not American Soldiers or Media), state it was safer to walk in the street at night, and now it's unsafe to walk in the morning.

Now yes Saddam did horrible things I should know I lived in Kuwait, I was born in Kuwait and I was barely 3 years when the Gulf War Invasion happened. So my parents tell me stories, and their families.

But if you think it's safer in Iraq now, your information is being biased that America did the best, thing they could.</CBody>

		<CBody>@gmz21 no one is arguing that the Americans did a blow job, they always do, but at least now women got rights and girls and boys can finally get schooling.
I mean it's a start for a free society, but whatever it is I don't think being threatened 24/7 by a fascist leader makes it any safer.
Maybe it was safer to walk at night because there weren't much "Freedom fighters" or much extremists active back then for the sole reason that they were afraid or collaborating with Saddam.
But getting rid of them will take effort and time and it should not stop now.

@deadman123 common interest is not a problem, there is no specific interests but what we want is a enjoyable group which is very practical.

		<CBody>You know that a theory could be proven wrong by the tiniest thing why their called theory not facts, and that is false the most agreed Theory is the Pythagorean Theory which is still a theory. I never stated I don't find the big bang theory incorrect you just began attacking man, I was using it as an example. 

Like if you want a civilized discussion you should try to understand both sides of the argument. Example would be the Iraq war you know what Iraqis say now, with Saddam their was safety but no freedom, but without Saddam we have freedom but no safety.

This doesn't mean that you're wrong or that stealth is wrong, you are both right. You believe now they can vote and not be scared of their government officials. While Stealth believes now there is a very high rate of crime, which wasn't around the time during Saddam's time.

I got an ATM card but no cheque book. This was with Doha bank. Try smaller less busy branches and speak to a customer services person and discuss your options with them. However, this was a few years back,.. they might have changed those rules. Try a few banks and ask if they can open you a savings account. Good luck !</CBody>

dont forget to attach your marriage certificate also because you are not allowed to sponsor your brother if you are not married and at the same time your family should be here with valid residence visa because if you are single, immigration will not allow you. the only thing you can do if you are single is to apply a tourist visa or business visa...</CBody>

		<CBody>lol .. You can call it "Super Glue". Just go to one of those small grocery stores and ask them. Usually all of them have it.

If not, you can try some hardware store in the musherib area. But the quantity will be much more than the "Super Glue"</CBody>

		<CBody>yellow sticker
is a parking ticket.   There are different fines depending on what the officer thinks your offense is  The fine ranges from 300 to 6,000!  Yes, that's not a typo.  I took mine to the City center mall, bottom floor Ministry of Interior kiosk.   Gave it to the nice man, along with my license and registration.   He asked for my bank card, swiped it and I paid 300QR fine and got 3 points.   All because I parked in a dirt lot.   shame on me!</CBody>

		<CBody>Sound the winning bell! You have just won a parking violation from the police! It'll cost you between 300/-QR and 500/-QR...depends on what kind of parking violation committed.

Take care of it immediately and be careful not to get anymore. It'll knock 3 points off of your driver's license and you only have 12 points on there. So now you have 9 points. If you hit 12 points, they'll revoke your license anywhere from 6 months to a year. Sucks, I know.</CBody>

		<CBody>what kind of router are you using btw? Can you check the IP range that your Router DHCP server [if it's working] is assigning to the clients? If you know the range, just try assigning your wireless connection on the PDA a static IP Address. The DHCP on the router might be disabled ...

		<CBody>you can hard reset your wireless router by pressing the small button at the back with a paper clip, BUT YOU WILL NEED TO RE-CONFIGURE THE ROUTER - anyway its just username and password for the ADSL setting you just have to obtain that information before doing the hard reset.

		<CBody>i didnt say there is problem with the router. its with the security maybe your pda doesnt authenticate  with security encryption better disable it first to verify.

or better yet try changing your security mode to "WEP" encryption "10/64-bits".
